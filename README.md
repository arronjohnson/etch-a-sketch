# Etch A Sketch

## About

This is a simple version of Etch A Sketch coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My primary focus was practicing and employing the various elements of basic JS I've learnt so far, such as DOM manipulation. I also made sure the layout was responsive, and touch controls worked for touch devices.
